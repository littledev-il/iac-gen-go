# Multi-Environment AWS Infrastructure Setup

## Problem Statement
Design a comprehensive AWS infrastructure solution using **CDKTF (Terraform CDK) with Go** that creates multiple isolated environments for development, testing, and production stages. The infrastructure must be secure, scalable, highly available, and compliant with enterprise standards.

## Background
The organization requires a robust, multi-environment AWS infrastructure that supports different development lifecycles while maintaining consistency, security, and cost-effectiveness. Each environment must be isolated yet follow identical architectural patterns to ensure predictable deployments and operations.

## Technical Requirements

### Infrastructure Platform
- **Framework**: CDKTF (Cloud Development Kit for Terraform) with Go
- **State Management**: Terraform state files with remote backend (S3)
- **Naming Convention**: All resources must use ENVIRONMENT_SUFFIX for unique identification
- **Regions**: Primary region (us-east-1) with cross-region replication capabilities

### Environment Architecture

#### 1. Network Infrastructure
- **VPC Isolation**: Each environment gets its own VPC with non-overlapping CIDR blocks
- **CIDR Allocation**:
  - Development: 10.0.0.0/16
  - Testing: 10.1.0.0/16  
  - Production: 10.2.0.0/16
- **Multi-AZ Setup**: Distribute resources across 3 availability zones
- **Subnet Strategy**:
  - Public subnets: 10.x.1.0/24, 10.x.2.0/24, 10.x.3.0/24
  - Private subnets: 10.x.11.0/24, 10.x.12.0/24, 10.x.13.0/24
  - Database subnets: 10.x.21.0/24, 10.x.22.0/24, 10.x.23.0/24

#### 2. Compute Resources
- **Bastion Host**: Single jump server in public subnet with restricted access
- **Application Servers**: Auto Scaling Group in private subnets
  - Min: 2 instances
  - Max: 10 instances  
  - Desired: 3 instances
- **Instance Types**: t3.medium for dev/test, t3.large for production
- **AMI**: Latest Amazon Linux 2023
- **IAM Roles**: Least privilege access for EC2 instances

#### 3. Database Layer
- **RDS Multi-AZ**: PostgreSQL database in database subnets
- **Backup Strategy**: Automated backups with 7-day retention
- **Cross-Region Replication**: Read replicas in secondary region
- **Encryption**: At-rest encryption with AWS managed keys
- **Security**: Database security groups allowing access only from private subnets

#### 4. Storage & Monitoring
- **S3 Buckets**: Application data storage with versioning
- **Cross-Region Replication**: Automatic replication to secondary region
- **Lambda Monitoring**: Functions to log S3 access patterns
- **CloudWatch**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- **Encryption**: All data encrypted at rest and in transit

#### 5. Security Requirements
- **Network ACLs**: Restrictive rules for subnet-level security
- **Security Groups**: 
  - Bastion: SSH (22) from specific IP ranges
  - ALB: HTTP (80), HTTPS (443) from internet
  - App servers: HTTP (8080) from ALB only
  - Database: PostgreSQL (5432) from app servers only
- **IAM Policies**: Least privilege access model
- **VPC Flow Logs**: Network traffic logging for security analysis

#### 6. High Availability & Scalability
- **Application Load Balancer**: Distribute traffic across AZs
- **Auto Scaling**: CPU and memory-based scaling policies
- **Health Checks**: Application and infrastructure health monitoring
- **Route 53**: DNS failover and health checks

#### 7. Tagging Strategy
All resources must include the following tags:
- Environment: {dev|test|prod}
- Project: multi-env-infrastructure
- Team: platform-engineering
- CostCenter: {business-unit}
- ManagedBy: terraform
- CreatedDate: {creation-timestamp}

## Technical Constraints

### Development Standards
- **Code Structure**: Modular Go packages for reusability
- **Testing**: Unit tests for all infrastructure components
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and inline documentation
- **State Management**: Remote state backend with locking
- **Security**: No hardcoded secrets or credentials

### Compliance Requirements
- **Data Residency**: All data must remain in specified regions
- **Backup Requirements**: 99.9% data durability guarantee
- **Access Logging**: All resource access must be logged
- **Encryption**: AES-256 encryption for all data at rest
- **Network Security**: Zero-trust network architecture

### Operational Requirements
- **Deployment**: Automated via CI/CD pipeline
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch dashboards for each environment
- **Alerting**: SNS notifications for critical events
- **Cost Management**: Resource optimization and cost monitoring
- **Disaster Recovery**: RTO < 4 hours, RPO < 1 hour

## Success Criteria
1. Successfully deploy identical infrastructure across 3 environments
2. Pass all security compliance checks
3. Demonstrate cross-region failover capabilities
4. Achieve target performance metrics (latency < 200ms)
5. Complete automated backup and restore procedures
6. Validate monitoring and alerting functionality

## Deliverables
- CDKTF Go code in lib/ directory
- Unit tests in tests/ directory
- Infrastructure documentation
- Deployment and operation procedures
- Security and compliance validation reports
